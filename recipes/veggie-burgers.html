<h2>You can't beat a good veggie burger. The very best if them are substantial and tasty and, if you're a meat eater, you don't even miss the meat. This is one of those great burgers. The addition of a small amount of Parmesan gives them a fantastic sharp, rich taste. Serve with a large salad and enjoy!</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>220g medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>low-calorie cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, grated</li>
        <li>50g green beans, trimmed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>50g cauliflower florets, finely chopped</li>
        <li>50g broccoli florets, finely chopped</li>
        <li>50g frozen peas</li>
        <li>50g sweetcorn kernels(tinned and drained, or frozen)</li>
        <li>handful of fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>30g Parmesan (or vegetarian hard cheese)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>To serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 wholemeal burger buns</li>
        <li>lettuce leaves</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water until soft, then drain well and mash with a hand-held masher or fork.</li>
        <li>Spray a large frying pan with some low-carie cooking spray and place over a medium heat. Add the garlic and all the vegetables (except the eas and sweetcorn) and cook for 5 minutes, stirring so they don't start to colour. Add the peas and sweetcorn and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the mashed potato and vegetables together in a bowl, then stir in the chopped parsley and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into four equal pieces, and form each piece into a burger shape. (You can freeze the burgers at this point for cooking on another day. Thoroughly defrost the burgers before cooking).</li>
        <li>Spray the frying pan with some low-calorie cooking spray and place over a medium heat. Add the burgers and cook for 5 minutes or until they are golden brown on the bottom, then turn them carefully and cook for another few minutes. When the other side is golden brown, remove from the heat and serve the burgers on their own, or in a wholemeal roll packed with salad.</li>
